6 best Misfits tunes rapid-recorded in 3 hours with hammond church-basement-style organ and voice, very unique and super-catchy. Organ gets more cranky and noisy over the recording session so the result is very lo-fi charm, and the somewhat erodable flexidisc is the perfect format to compliment the concept.

This is a rare Collis Browne solo effort. AND, even more rare legal clearance was purchased from Danzig himself [via various music industry bureaucracy].
