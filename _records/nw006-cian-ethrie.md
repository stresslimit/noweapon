So many years ago, in the early 2000’s, there was a jangling and a tinkering out of the underbrush that soon came to be known as the Eternal Song of Cian Éthrie — many heard it, many felt true and alive in its presence and words like “free folk” and “psychadelic lo-fi improv” just didn’t do justice to the Soul of it.

Many years later there are but few traces of their influential but now rare sound, which once one almost took for granted… With only a few self-releases, a CD on Spain’s Lucky Kitchen label, and many, many beautiful memories planted in hearts in Montreal and beyond, we are proud to re-release the mysterious band’s only vinyl offering, a self-titled 7″ with silkscreen cover.
