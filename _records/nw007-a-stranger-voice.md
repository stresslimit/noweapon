<!-- At least a year in the making, this 2nd EP from Montreal’s Technical Kidman is well worth the wait. This record has some serious kick-ass!

Hypnotic, slightly dark synth pop/rock/showgaze with all the best subtle references to the 80’s & 90’s. But this is not retro-chic, it could only have happened NOW! -->
