<p>Starting at 4 or 5 on this saturday afternoon and going on late into the night and well into the morning. An evening of urban exploration accompanied by a soundtrack of experimental ambient noise, rock and roll favorites and idm glitchiness followed by a dark and heavy night of dancing to the best in crunk, breakcore, jungle, electro, surf and whatever other filth our resident musicks bring. All set in the midst of natures easily achieved efforts to reclaim her property, to take root in an urban wasteland and to rake in the wealth. MAN VS. NATURE. MACHINE VS. WALL. UP AGAINST THE FOUNDATIONS MUTHAFUCKA.</p>

<h3>PLEASE READ:</h3>
	
<p>This is a free outdoor event. Be a good boy/girl/etc. Be prepared. Bring some warmer gear for the evening, bring something to keep you inebriated but also bring something to keep you hydrated. Think about food, we may provide a little but maybe pack some for yourself and some friends and strangers as well. Who doesnt like eating!!?? If yr gonna get fucked up stay with the crowd, there are train tracks nearby as well as other dangers you will learn about if you get there early enough to explore. Be aware of your surroundings and act accordingly. Lets be respectful of our surroundings. Use garbage cans, we'll sort out the recycling later.<br><br><b>IF (WHEN ) POLICE SHOW UP:<br><br></b>Dont run away screaming. Dont run at them screaming. Try to appear to be having a wholesome good time your conscience feels clear about (parties are a-okay) and maybe think about hiding that beer til they go away. Let someone who is acting in charge take care of it. Do not crowd the police, theyre like frightened animals. Partying in a field with friends is not illegal [well sort of]. Remember that. <br>
		<b><br>RAIN:<br><br></b>If its raining like crazy, the event is canceled. If its spitting a little its on. <br><br><b>ALL THAT BEING SAID:</b><br></p>
		
		<p>We cant wait to see you!</p>
